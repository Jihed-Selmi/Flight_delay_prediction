    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to the preprocessing of data collected from three different sources: flights, weather, and reviews. The purpose of this notebook is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks. Preprocessing includes handling missing values, identifying and dealing with outliers, and merging the datasets into a single cohesive structure.\n",

    "The preprocessing will be conducted in the following order:\n",
    "1. **Initial Exploration**: Quick overview of the datasets to understand the structure and content.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "    - Removing duplicates.\n",
    "    - Fixing structural errors (e.g., mislabeled classes, wrong data types).\n",
    "3. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "    - Identifying missing values.\n",
    "    - Deciding on a strategy to handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).\n",
    "4. **Outlier Detection**:\n",
    "    - Statistical methods to detect outliers.\n",
    "    - Deciding on a strategy to handle outliers (e.g., trimming, capping, or correcting).\n",
    "5. **Data Integration**:\n",
    "    - Aligning datasets by common attributes.\n",
    "    - Merging datasets into a unified table.\n",
    "6. **Data Transformation**:\n",
    "    - Normalization or scaling.\n",
    "    - Encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "7. **Final Inspection**:\n",
    "    - Ensuring the processed data meets the initial objectives.\n",
    "    - Storing the preprocessed data in a suitable format.\n",

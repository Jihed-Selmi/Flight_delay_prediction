Like this airport with the teddybear. However almost ALWAYS super crowded in the transit area. But in case you are flying ex DOH  the check in and security check is fast and smooth.,doh


The best airport that i've been. So big  so amasing. The lounge of business class  it's something. 3 chef's at same time cooking for you in the moment. All the lounge  food  rest area  shower  everithing  whith a 5 star quality. Well done Qatar.,doh


Best terminal I've experienced. Huge  beautiful  comfortable. Lots of concourse space to walk and stretch legs before and after long flights.,doh


Exiting aircraft by stairs and taking bus to terminal is very annoying. They have the money  build bigger terminal with gates,doh


I have never been to Doha before. The airport is easy to navigate and most of the staff speak English. A custodian was cleaning the bathroom and asked where I came from. I told him I came from Boston  Massachusetts  United States. The announcements were automated and easy to understand.,doh


E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T-!-!-! Only issue I have is the immigration stamped over some of my African stamps and didn't stamp on the page I wanted...oh well,doh


The airport had good amenities like the stores  food  lounges were all good. Also The transfer of flights was good.,doh


Very big and modern airport thats easy to navigate through  but you might get a bit lost in the duty-free section next to the bear and an unstable wifi.,doh


Amazing airport  especially for transfering passengers. A lot of choices for food and very diverse duty-free section near the bear and at the orchard.,doh


DOHA Hamada is a very modern airport with only 1 terminal that's more convenient for passengers. The facilities are easy to use and modern. The Orchard is a nice place to relax after a long flight. The only downside was the very unstable wifi. Lastly  the airport is not the best for plane spotting especially during daytime when the rotating solar panels covers up the glass. And the gate C13 is the only place you can get a good view.,doh


Großer Airport  viel Verkehr auf dem Flugfeld und durch Baustellen aktuell sogar Staus der Transferbusse und anderer Fahrzeuge zur Anfertigung.,doh


Quite large and therefore quite confusing airport. The signage to the gates is very good  as is the WiFi and the friendliness of the staff.,doh


The time from the bus gate back to the terminal takes ages. Bus has to avoid several construction areas. Would be good after construction complete.,doh


I liked the flight very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much,doh


This is one of the best airports in the world! The lounge is stunning and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend the first class lounge if you are traveling in first class.,doh


The new terminal at Doha is really exceptional. However  at this time  it appears that the powers that be are still working out the kinks of operations there.,doh


Doha's Hamad International Airport is  quite frankly  hard to beat. Services are excellent and it is very well maintained. I can also highly recommend the Oryx Airport Transit Hotel.,doh


Logistics at the airport is terrible. Arriving and departing gates were close  but the extra security check and the shopping areas meant walking about a mile to get to the connecting flight.,doh


Airport seems to be built for shopping and not so much smooth connections between flight. Often remote parking. Buses were running about  most likely for lacking docking to the terminal.,doh


The transfer was smooth  and the terminal is modern and clean. The lounge food and environment was fantastic!,doh


The bestest transit experience. No hustle  no queue  get down from the fligh tand go to the gates for onward journey. And the HIA is excellent,doh

I Had a connection so all 1 stars is because I did not use them. ....................................,doh


Incredible big airport of Doha  transfert time was short  so I couldn't buy something (just a cap lol),doh


Doha great. Al-Safwa Lounge (1st Class or Platinum) best I've ever seen. Try the quiet area sleep rooms. As always (and I don't know why this is) WiFi in that airport is sketchy. Not fast and hard to connect  even in the lounges. But again the staff everywhere are so helpful and kind.,doh


Doha is getting older and older; but there's huge teddy bear. It's crowded and there's a long line for the restroom. So be prepared.,doh


Can't bring water into plane! The last security check is just before entering the gate & they'll take your water away. How silly!,doh


Transfer security is highly efficient Al Maha Lounge is an ok place to spend the night  altough a bit overpriced IMO. Somewhat limited selection of food and drinks,doh


Overall everything as service was good Food and beverage very expensive at the airport Wifi very bad always disconnected and very slow,doh


Wlan ziemlich schlecht  im Indoor Garten gute Möglichkeiten sich hinzulegen/chillen (bei C Gates 20/30),doh


Lounge für QR Business ist krass! Überall Personal  welches einem weiterhilft. Im Essensbereich oben direkter Empfang und zum Tisch begleiten  Erklärung  wie Buffet/Bestellung funktioniert und Möglichkeit A la Carte zu bestellen usw.. Fühlt sich schon um einiges luxuriöser an. WLAN am Flughafen aber nicht so toll,doh


Una vez más espectacular: tamaño gigantesco  empleados distribuidos por todo el aeropuerto para informar y agilizar los tránsitos  baños impecables...,doh


Lo único negativo  unos 15-20 minutos de traslado en jardinera desde el avión en remoto a la terminal. Los pasajeros que iban justos en transfer  con el corazón en la boca. De resto  terminal espectacular  con baños limpiándose permanentemente y elementos decorativos grandiosos. La definición más correcta sería: centro comercial de lujo con puertas de embarque.,doh


Very large spacious airport but had to be bussed to remote stand and waited for some time before boarding,doh


this time tha airport wasnt bad as last time because at that time a football match was going on but still pretty bad airport,doh


this airport sucks they dont have proper food they made me sick with their terrible food we had to wait many hourse and people were mean the only thing good was the sculptures,doh


Great airport. This one clearly has aa load of money behind it. The transfers process was simple enough and despite feeling like they weren't really checking the bags after going through security  the boarding process was smooth and pleasant.,doh


The walk to the baggage claim was long it was about 15-20 minutes people were getting lost everywhere,doh


It was an excellent experience the teddy bear of the airport that made it an attraction to people and the world cup,doh


Nice and clean airport  but expectations were higher given their exaggerated claims about the airport being the best in the world,doh


Overall a very pleasant first experience on arrival. Just the airport wifi is literally rubbish and hardly working properly.,doh


Great airport but it is actually really annoying to check in. You are forced to be helped even though it is easier to do it yourself in the self check-in. I had to spell my name out loud for him instead of taking 3 seconds typing it myself.,doh


As Business Class passenger on a stopover at Doha Airport no access to the lounge because to many people (30 min waiting time). Queue for a shower/toilet 45 min (same lounge). Great service  great stopover  won't come again.,doh


Very Middle East airport. Feels grand and busy even at early morning. It is an ok airport was transferring.,doh


Cool airport but unfortunately didn't get to spend much time here since we had a short layover but if you were going to the USA you had to go through two types of security which I've never had to do that before.,doh

Check in took 30 mins with only one person in front of me No space in the Al Mourjan lounge even at 7 am. 30 mins wait for restaurant - poor show from QR,doh


Best Airport with guiding Stuff  Clean and have best duty free shop with Cheap and best Quality. Not single airlines is delayed  it have mosque after each and every 15 minute of walk  Bathroom is clean and has Good facilities as well Lounge obviously in hamad is one of the best one and I prefer this than any other lounge in the entire world except Seoul and Tokyo Airport Hamad Airport just need to improve her WiFi  it work very slow and will take time to understand if his to sign in,doh

J'ai vécu la meilleure expérience avec cet aéroport. Le service est bien agréable pour mon vol de Francfort et le Duty Free répond parfaitement à mes critères. Durant mon enregistrement  il n'y a eu aucun problèmes et la douane est passée comme un TGV.,tun


No wifi  no available public transportation to the airport  you have to remove your shoes for the security check  during the check in the guy wanted to get a bribe.,tun


Mi aspettavo di più! Per essere l'aeroporto che serve la capitale dello Stato della Tunisia  sembrava perlopiù un aeroporto provinciale! Non sono molto moderni...,tun


Tunis airport really doesn't get better ... there are some pretty good things about it; the duty free shop is pleasant as are the other shopping options  but for those wishing to wait in peace  the airport leaves much to be desired. The check in is chaotic; security lines long and inefficient and the passport control simply lethargic. Allow plenty of time  although you won't really know what to do with it if you get through the formalities quickly. One very good facility is in the arrivals hall you can get a complimentary Orange SIM card loaded with sufficient data to get a cab or such like - additional time can be purchased easily in the city.,tun


In der Lounge hat man scheinbar noch nie von Allianzen und Statusanerkennung gehört  dafür ist das Essen und Trinken zum Kaufen unverschämt teuer. 3 50 Euro für 0 25 L Dose Cola??,tun


Probably the worst airport I have ever been to! Be prepared for queueing and queueing and queueing...Despite having a mobile boarding pass you need to go to the check-in desks (and queue!) in order to get a printed boarding pass which is going to be looked at by a lot persons who are literally waiting in line! The absolute horror is the passport control: Almost one hour to get through it in a cramped  way too warm and oppressive hall. WiFi is not working although they are praising it everywhere. In shops  foreigners are urged to pay in Euro. What a terrible experience...,tun


Screens didn’t show my flight. The gatenumber on my boarding pass turned out to be wrong. Nobody knew where to go. What a mess,tun


Immigration lines can be a nightmare. If traveling through this airport frequently  prepare by picking up several departure/arrival cards and completing as much as possible. Checking in can also be a hassle and most European flight counters are in an area not well marked.,tun

The worst airport I have ever been. Dirty  dirty toilets  no trash bins  wifi to which is almost impossible to connect to  no power sockets (!)  rude custom officials employees  unhelpful staff who is expecting tips everytime. Watch out for taxi drivers who are cheating on you (even when you are using taxis from official point).,tun

the only good things about it is it's simplicity   cleanness  and easy to reach. there is no free wifi  the checkin is alright  security check are pretty heavy due to special conditions  terminal facilities are not that impressive since its pretty simple one. food  there are no food and the retail is plain simple and can not accept USD  the cafes are pretty simple.,tun

1- Getting to airport: this is a city airport. quite quick to acess via a private car / taxi. public transportation is almost inexistant / very bad however. 2- facilities: you just get to wait for the flight to depart. Out of the 5 public phones  1 only was working. People still smoke inside (although forbidden). toilets always wet... 3- What wifi ? none... 4- Food and retail: few shops. price is at least 5 to 10 times the price outside (this isnt the same in other international airports  where the ratio is much more normnal). Some shops you can't even pay in local currency 5- Lounge: the poorest lounge i ever seen. all you can do is sit on a leather chair. no tv (there is a place for it  but it's not there). no food except some cookies (salty and terrible) and some very bad processed juice.. 6- Immigration: frequently you have people cutting through the lanes. clear they know some staff there. not well organized in general... 7- baggage claim; the airport is know to have an organized thief organization that opens and steals stuff from bagages.... yet the management is so stupid and it's been years without cameras in the bagage handling area  or else why didnt they cought the thieves... put extract locks and plastic on your luggage if you come here... or depart from here.,tun


Nice airport in the complex with some little problems that could be resolved. Food and retails services were good but the baggage claim was not present as we lost a luggage. Terminals and facilities are well indicated. There is no WiFi but services for the city are available and fine,tun


Very average airport. The good thing is that you don't get confused: All flight travellers go through same areas: 1 Checkin area  1 Border police area  1 Security check area  ... only the gate will differ from a flight to another; even gates: you can go from any gate to any other gate through the airport. The bad thing is that there is one queue per border police officer: you may see others arround going fast whereas you are stuck in a queue served by a lazy officer. TAX on leave ------------------ TAX need to be paid when leaving the country: if you are non Maghreb citizen  you will need to purchase a stamp (a tax of 30 TND ~ 31 USD ~ 29 EUR) from bank offices inside the airport. before you can access border police gates. Transportation: -------------------- Don't ask about public transportaion from the airport: you will need to take a taxi. What you will pay will differ depending on from where you take the Taxi: a. It's recommended that you take the stairs and go to 1st floor before getting out of the airport. When you leave the airport on first floor  there you can find taxis that operate the meter (Insist on that). b. If you choose in stead to take a taxi from ground floor then  in most cases the meter will not be operated: best is to negociate the fee before you go. Any way in case of dispute with taxi driver and you want not to cede then simply ask him to divert to police office and he will finally accept: As a foreign visitor you are always alright for a police officer. Here are some price sample taxi fees: Destination: City center (avenue Mohamed V  avenue bourguiba  Novotel hotel  Ibis hotel  la maison blanche  Africa hotel  Lac-1: Concorde hotel  Lac-1 Acropole hotel ...): the average cost is 5 Dinars (~ 2.5 USD). After 21:00 the price becomes ~7.5 Dinars (~3.8 USD) . If you are going to Gammart then taxi fee may reach 20 TND (~10 USD).,tun

Be careful. It's quite old and dark place. You can go through customs with bomb  sit in a plane without passport. Nobody cares. Just fuck off and fly to place  that you should fly  service doesn't give a fuck.,tun


Overall  very average aiport .Queue start even outside of the airport for the security check which could be very long during summer .Check in area a bit chaotic . wifi is not for free even in the business lounge  and prices are hectic .Buisness lounge is OK  nice sofas   some snacks (sandwiches ..) and drinks are available  nice view on the tarmac though . You can find plenty of stuffs on the duty free on a good price .Finally  queues on arrival and departure could be very long .,tun


this airport is very good it's nice and you can find many good facilities you can get all food and retail servecies there i hope this review help you to get an idea about this airport ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,tun

An average airport considered the local standards. At least it is cleanish and it features some lounges. Queues at border control leaving the country can be very long and slow. Gates facilities are quite old and obsolete  but one should consider the situation in the country  which is not at its best right now.,tun

Not a bad airport  not an amazing airport  just a place where you can take the plane to another place...,tun


on n'a pas beaucoup attendu les bagages (strange),tun


Can't remember,tun


Tunis-Carthage <3 Definitely my favorite airport  in spite of all ! Actually it's my city's airport  that's why I like it so much. But it's a very beautiful airport after all.,tun


Like this airport with the teddybear. However almost ALWAYS super crowded in the transit area. But in case you are flying ex DOH  the check in and security check is fast and smooth.,doh


The best airport that i've been. So big  so amasing. The lounge of business class  it's something. 3 chef's at same time cooking for you in the moment. All the lounge  food  rest area  shower  everithing  whith a 5 star quality. Well done Qatar.,doh


Best terminal I've experienced. Huge  beautiful  comfortable. Lots of concourse space to walk and stretch legs before and after long flights.,doh


Exiting aircraft by stairs and taking bus to terminal is very annoying. They have the money  build bigger terminal with gates,doh


I have never been to Doha before. The airport is easy to navigate and most of the staff speak English. A custodian was cleaning the bathroom and asked where I came from. I told him I came from Boston  Massachusetts  United States. The announcements were automated and easy to understand.,doh


E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T-!-!-! Only issue I have is the immigration stamped over some of my African stamps and didn't stamp on the page I wanted...oh well,doh


The airport had good amenities like the stores  food  lounges were all good. Also The transfer of flights was good.,doh


Very big and modern airport thats easy to navigate through  but you might get a bit lost in the duty-free section next to the bear and an unstable wifi.,doh


Amazing airport  especially for transfering passengers. A lot of choices for food and very diverse duty-free section near the bear and at the orchard.,doh


DOHA Hamada is a very modern airport with only 1 terminal that's more convenient for passengers. The facilities are easy to use and modern. The Orchard is a nice place to relax after a long flight. The only downside was the very unstable wifi. Lastly  the airport is not the best for plane spotting especially during daytime when the rotating solar panels covers up the glass. And the gate C13 is the only place you can get a good view.,doh


Großer Airport  viel Verkehr auf dem Flugfeld und durch Baustellen aktuell sogar Staus der Transferbusse und anderer Fahrzeuge zur Anfertigung.,doh


Quite large and therefore quite confusing airport. The signage to the gates is very good  as is the WiFi and the friendliness of the staff.,doh


The time from the bus gate back to the terminal takes ages. Bus has to avoid several construction areas. Would be good after construction complete.,doh


I liked the flight very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much,doh


This is one of the best airports in the world! The lounge is stunning and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend the first class lounge if you are traveling in first class.,doh


The new terminal at Doha is really exceptional. However  at this time  it appears that the powers that be are still working out the kinks of operations there.,doh


Doha's Hamad International Airport is  quite frankly  hard to beat. Services are excellent and it is very well maintained. I can also highly recommend the Oryx Airport Transit Hotel.,doh


Logistics at the airport is terrible. Arriving and departing gates were close  but the extra security check and the shopping areas meant walking about a mile to get to the connecting flight.,doh


Airport seems to be built for shopping and not so much smooth connections between flight. Often remote parking. Buses were running about  most likely for lacking docking to the terminal.,doh


The transfer was smooth  and the terminal is modern and clean. The lounge food and environment was fantastic!,doh


The bestest transit experience. No hustle  no queue  get down from the fligh tand go to the gates for onward journey. And the HIA is excellent,doh

I Had a connection so all 1 stars is because I did not use them. ....................................,doh


Incredible big airport of Doha  transfert time was short  so I couldn't buy something (just a cap lol),doh


Doha great. Al-Safwa Lounge (1st Class or Platinum) best I've ever seen. Try the quiet area sleep rooms. As always (and I don't know why this is) WiFi in that airport is sketchy. Not fast and hard to connect  even in the lounges. But again the staff everywhere are so helpful and kind.,doh


Doha is getting older and older; but there's huge teddy bear. It's crowded and there's a long line for the restroom. So be prepared.,doh


Can't bring water into plane! The last security check is just before entering the gate & they'll take your water away. How silly!,doh


Transfer security is highly efficient Al Maha Lounge is an ok place to spend the night  altough a bit overpriced IMO. Somewhat limited selection of food and drinks,doh


Overall everything as service was good Food and beverage very expensive at the airport Wifi very bad always disconnected and very slow,doh


Wlan ziemlich schlecht  im Indoor Garten gute Möglichkeiten sich hinzulegen/chillen (bei C Gates 20/30),doh


Lounge für QR Business ist krass! Überall Personal  welches einem weiterhilft. Im Essensbereich oben direkter Empfang und zum Tisch begleiten  Erklärung  wie Buffet/Bestellung funktioniert und Möglichkeit A la Carte zu bestellen usw.. Fühlt sich schon um einiges luxuriöser an. WLAN am Flughafen aber nicht so toll,doh


Una vez más espectacular: tamaño gigantesco  empleados distribuidos por todo el aeropuerto para informar y agilizar los tránsitos  baños impecables...,doh


Lo único negativo  unos 15-20 minutos de traslado en jardinera desde el avión en remoto a la terminal. Los pasajeros que iban justos en transfer  con el corazón en la boca. De resto  terminal espectacular  con baños limpiándose permanentemente y elementos decorativos grandiosos. La definición más correcta sería: centro comercial de lujo con puertas de embarque.,doh


Very large spacious airport but had to be bussed to remote stand and waited for some time before boarding,doh


this time tha airport wasnt bad as last time because at that time a football match was going on but still pretty bad airport,doh


this airport sucks they dont have proper food they made me sick with their terrible food we had to wait many hourse and people were mean the only thing good was the sculptures,doh


Great airport. This one clearly has aa load of money behind it. The transfers process was simple enough and despite feeling like they weren't really checking the bags after going through security  the boarding process was smooth and pleasant.,doh


The walk to the baggage claim was long it was about 15-20 minutes people were getting lost everywhere,doh


It was an excellent experience the teddy bear of the airport that made it an attraction to people and the world cup,doh


Nice and clean airport  but expectations were higher given their exaggerated claims about the airport being the best in the world,doh


Overall a very pleasant first experience on arrival. Just the airport wifi is literally rubbish and hardly working properly.,doh


Great airport but it is actually really annoying to check in. You are forced to be helped even though it is easier to do it yourself in the self check-in. I had to spell my name out loud for him instead of taking 3 seconds typing it myself.,doh


As Business Class passenger on a stopover at Doha Airport no access to the lounge because to many people (30 min waiting time). Queue for a shower/toilet 45 min (same lounge). Great service  great stopover  won't come again.,doh


Very Middle East airport. Feels grand and busy even at early morning. It is an ok airport was transferring.,doh


Cool airport but unfortunately didn't get to spend much time here since we had a short layover but if you were going to the USA you had to go through two types of security which I've never had to do that before.,doh

Check in took 30 mins with only one person in front of me No space in the Al Mourjan lounge even at 7 am. 30 mins wait for restaurant - poor show from QR,doh


Best Airport with guiding Stuff  Clean and have best duty free shop with Cheap and best Quality. Not single airlines is delayed  it have mosque after each and every 15 minute of walk  Bathroom is clean and has Good facilities as well Lounge obviously in hamad is one of the best one and I prefer this than any other lounge in the entire world except Seoul and Tokyo Airport Hamad Airport just need to improve her WiFi  it work very slow and will take time to understand if his to sign in,doh
